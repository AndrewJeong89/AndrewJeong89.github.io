# Disaster Relief

# Titanic Survival

## Scenario

As a data scientist with a research firm that specializes in emergency management. In advance of client work, you've been asked to create and train a logistic regression model that can show off the firm's capabilities in disaster analysis.

Frequently after a disaster, researchers and firms will come in to give an independent review of an incident. While your firm doesn't have any current client data that it can share with you so that you may test and deploy your model, it does have data from the 1912 titanic disaster that it has stored in a remote database.

The goal of this study is to train a model to predict survival of future disasters and factors involved with likelihood of survival.


## Risks & Assumptions: 



## VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:

#### SURVIVAL      

    Survival
    (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
                
#### PCLASS          
    Passenger Class
    (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)

**name**: Name  
**sex**: Sex  
**age**: Age  
**sibsp**: Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
**parch**: Number of Parents/Children Aboard  
**ticket**: Ticket Number  
**fare**: Passenger Fare  
**cabin**: Cabin
**embarked**: Port of Embarkation  
        
        (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
    

#### SPECIAL NOTES:
    1. Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
    1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

    2. Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
    If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

    3.  With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
    some relations were ignored. 

##### The following are the definitions used for sibsp and parch.

**Sibling:** Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic

**Spouse:** Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)

**Parent:** Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic

**Child:** Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
the definitions do not support such relations.

### Using Postgre SQL

Acquiring the titanic data set required connecting to a database in AWS (Amazon Web Services) and loading the data locally to perform analysis and predict titanic surival based on various features.

## Data Cleaning/ Munging

Since the dataset is a famous one, used throughout the education world and beyond, the data was already clean and there was no steps necessary to clean up the data for analysis. 

## Data Analysis / EDA

In analyzing the titanic data set, SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, was used to implement SQL queries within Jupyter notebook and the Python framework. Initally, a simple SQL query was used to check features of the data and get a glimpse of the data that will be modeled. By using aggregation fuctions within SQL, the max fare was found to be $512.33. The average fare price came out to $32.20. The average age of passengers on the titanic was around 30. Using SQL, the number of passengers in each class (from classes 1 to 3) were also found. Class 3 had 491 passengers, class 2 had 184, and class 1 had 216 passengers.

The histogram of the age distribution shows that the majority of passengers are in their 20s and 30s and there is a declining trend of lower count of passengers as age increases from ages of 20 and older.

The scatter plot shows the relationship of fare and age. The two most expensive fares of around $500 were bought by two people in their high 30's. The vast majority of titanic fare prices were int he below 100 range. There was a group of people in their 20's buying tickets between $200 to $300. 

## Data Mining/ Wrangling

From there the data was converted to a dataframe. After looking at the data, it was determined that the column for cabin number was irrelevant in determing whether a passenger would survive a disaster because of the random allotment of cabin numbers to passengers. Therefore, the cabin column was dropped. Dummy variables were created for sex of the passenger. One for male and one for female. For the remaining variables/ columns (embarked, passenger class, number of siblings/ spouses, and number of children/parents), Patsy was used to create dummy variables. 

### Logistic Regression and Model Validation

Since some variables had continuous values and others were discrete values, each column was treated differently. Continous variables were left alone while discrete variables were dummified. These were columns were then concatenated to form the X variable for modeling purposes. The "Survived" column was set as the y with 1 being "survived" and 0 being "not survived". Next a train, test split was done to randomize the training data and testing data. From there, in order to normalize the continous variables and transform the data through scaling, a standard scaler was used to scale the data based on the mean.

Next the logistic regression model was created using sci-kit learn. After running the logistic regression, the model was fitted and used to predict survival. By examining the coefficient values of each feature, the impact each feature has on the model could be determined. In this particular model, the male sex, having 3 siblings or spouses, and passenger class 3 were found to have the highest impact on survival aboard the titanic. A negative coefficient indicated a higher chance of dying while a positive coefficient relayed a higher chance of survival. 

#### Classificaiton Report and Benchmarks

The model was then scored to test the accuracy. The accuracy score came out to .78 and the mean of the cross validation score came out to .77. Next a classficaiton report gave us the precision (TP/(TP + FP), recall (TP/(TP + FN), and f1 scores (mean of precision and recall). The average precision score, recall score, and f1 score all came out to .78. 

#### Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows us the performance of the classfication model showing actual vs predictions and how well the model did. It gave a true positive value of 69, true negative value of 115, false positive value of 24 and false negative value of 27.

## Considerations

There are multiple considerations to observe when looking at this data. As mentioned earlier, some of the risk involved with this data is to observe how there is not sufficient data in each genre to correctly analyze and test the hypothesis. For example by finding the amount of songs in each genre that have it to the top 100, it is disproportionately in favor of Rock, Country, Rap, and R&B. Genres like Jazz, Reggae and Gospel only have one song in the top 100 in 2000. This can skew the data as it is only one point and the previous graph shows Jazz as the fastest genre to peak. 

In order to account for this looking at the relationship of mean days to peak with the amount of songs in each genre is crucial.

Below are charts showing the relationship between the days to peak by genre and the amount of songs in each genre.


The plot shows only 4 genres with more than 10 songs in the top 100 billboard and some correlation between amount of songs and average days to peak.

Lastly, it is important to consider proportion of time to peak (days on the chart) and how long the song has been in the top 100 by genre.

## Conclusion:

Using genre to predict time to peak is a mostly inconclusive process and prediction model. Other factors need to be taken into account to form a more accurate picture into which songs reach the peak the fastest and whether or not genre has an affect at all on time a song takes to peak.
