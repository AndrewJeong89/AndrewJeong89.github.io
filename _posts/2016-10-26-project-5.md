# Disaster Relief

# Titanic Survival

## Scenario

As a data scientist with a research firm that specializes in emergency management. In advance of client work, you've been asked to create and train a logistic regression model that can show off the firm's capabilities in disaster analysis.

Frequently after a disaster, researchers and firms will come in to give an independent review of an incident. While your firm doesn't have any current client data that it can share with you so that you may test and deploy your model, it does have data from the 1912 titanic disaster that it has stored in a remote database.

The goal of this study is to train a model to predict survival of future disasters and factors involved with likelihood of survival.


## Risks & Assumptions: 



## VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:

#### SURVIVAL      

    Survival
    (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
                
#### PCLASS          
    Passenger Class
    (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)

**name**: Name  
**sex**: Sex  
**age**: Age  
**sibsp**: Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard  
**parch**: Number of Parents/Children Aboard  
**ticket**: Ticket Number  
**fare**: Passenger Fare  
**cabin**: Cabin
**embarked**: Port of Embarkation  
        
        (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
    

#### SPECIAL NOTES:
    1. Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
    1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower

    2. Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
    If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5

    3.  With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
    some relations were ignored. 

##### The following are the definitions used for sibsp and parch.

**Sibling:** Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic

**Spouse:** Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)

**Parent:** Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic

**Child:** Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic

Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
the definitions do not support such relations.

### Using Postgre SQL

Acquiring the titanic data set required connecting to a database in AWS (Amazon Web Services) and loading the data locally to perform analysis and predict titanic surival based on various features.

## Data Cleaning/ Munging

Since the dataset is a famous one, used throughout the education world and beyond, the data was already clean and there was no steps necessary to clean up the data for analysis. 

## Data Analysis / EDA

In analyzing the titanic data set, SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, was used to implement SQL queries within Jupyter notebook and the Python framework. Initally, a simple SQL query was used to check features of the data and get a glimpse of the data that will be modeled. By using aggregation fuctions within SQL, the max fare was found to be $512.33. The average fare price came out to $32.20. The average age of passengers on the titanic was around 30. Using SQL, the number of passengers in each class (from classes 1 to 3) were also found. Class 3 had 491 passengers, class 2 had 184, and class 1 had 216 passengers.

## Data Mining

From there the data was converted to a dataframe. After looking at the data, it was determined that the column for Cabin number was irrelevant in determing whether and disaster survival and the cabin numbers were random in the dataset. Therefore, the Cabin column was dropped.


### P Value & T- Statistic

By comparing each individual rap songs' time to peak compared to rest of the songs' times to peak, we were able to find the P Value and T- Statistic

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference regardless of genre on how long it takes for a song to peak.

The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference, specifically with rap music.

The T- test revealed T statistic of 1.90 and a P Value of .0577

Since the p-value is higher than the significance level, assuming an alpha of .05, the alternative hypothesis is rejected and the null hypothesis is true.

TO NOTE:
** It is hard to exactly determine whether to reject null or alternative hypothesis in this particular scenario because the P Value is only very slightly higher than the .05 (difference of .007) **

## Considerations

There are multiple considerations to observe when looking at this data. As mentioned earlier, some of the risk involved with this data is to observe how there is not sufficient data in each genre to correctly analyze and test the hypothesis. For example by finding the amount of songs in each genre that have it to the top 100, it is disproportionately in favor of Rock, Country, Rap, and R&B. Genres like Jazz, Reggae and Gospel only have one song in the top 100 in 2000. This can skew the data as it is only one point and the previous graph shows Jazz as the fastest genre to peak. 

In order to account for this looking at the relationship of mean days to peak with the amount of songs in each genre is crucial.

Below are charts showing the relationship between the days to peak by genre and the amount of songs in each genre.


The plot shows only 4 genres with more than 10 songs in the top 100 billboard and some correlation between amount of songs and average days to peak.

Lastly, it is important to consider proportion of time to peak (days on the chart) and how long the song has been in the top 100 by genre.

## Conclusion:

Using genre to predict time to peak is a mostly inconclusive process and prediction model. Other factors need to be taken into account to form a more accurate picture into which songs reach the peak the fastest and whether or not genre has an affect at all on time a song takes to peak.
