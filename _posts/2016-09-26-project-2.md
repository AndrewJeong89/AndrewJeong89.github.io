# Hypothesis: 
       
## The genre Rap takes the longest time to peak.

Does genre have an influence on time it takes to peak?

# Risks & Assumptions: 

Billboard Top 100 data in 2000 is based on a combination of radio airplay and sales*
 
	Sales of tracks are calculated using CD sales and not independant tracks in 2000

# P Value & T- Statistic

Since the p-value is higher than the significance level, alpha (.05), the alternative hypothesis is rejected and the null hypothesis is true.

** It is hard to exactly calculate significance level though because it is only very slightly higher than the .05 (difference of .007)

# porportion of time to peak (days on the chart)
# Data insufficient for complete analysis
    #Jazz has too little songs
