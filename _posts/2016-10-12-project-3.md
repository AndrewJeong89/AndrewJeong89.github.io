# IOWA LIQUOR SALES 2015 - 2016

## Market Opportunity / Business Expansion

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that his team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront. Using statewide Iowa liquor store transactional data for 2105 and Q1 2016, recommendations for viable expansion locations were made. A model was also created using this data to create a prediction for future sales and suggestions for average bottle price and the amount of bottles sold, need to be presented.
       
### Which Iowa location is the best to open a new store?

Strategic thinking behind the decision of a new Iowa liquor store location is dervied from looking at a variety of factors and variables associated with sales and profit of stores in specific areas. Some notable factors include county, zipcode, city, item description, price per bottle, cost per bottle, bottles sold, and sales. The data had over 2.7 million liquor sales transactions and 18 characteristics.


## Risks & Assumptions: 

When looking at location, there are three possible ways to segment out Iowa into location territories. The three ways to segment Iowa in our dataset is through counties, zipcodes, and cities. When looking at the quantity of stores by zipcode, cities, and counties, counties contained the most amount of stores as it represents the largest area out of the three location types. A further dive into the data shows that after the top 10 counties, the amount of stores per county drops to less than 20. Therefore, drilling down into zipcodes and cities would cause the amount of stores in each location to be much smaller. 

Another assumption/ risk to consider is the the multi- colinearlity between many of the variables. The amount of bottles sold and the price of the bottles has a direct correlation with profit and sales. Therefore, our model's  may seem too perfect and may be a refelection of the relationship of price of bottle * bottles sold = total sales. 

Lastly, because of very large outliers (presumably due to alcohol distributors in the state of Iowa, with huge sales) we took the route of looking at both the mean and the median to model out our predictions. The To account for the outliers without directly removing them, the median gave us a better estimate of our average sales and we looked at both to come


## Data Cleaning/ Munging

Steps in cleaning data: 

 1 Convert money columns from string to float

 2 Checking to see if all zipcodes have length of 5 and changed to integer
       
       Found 1 zipcode value '712-2', turns out to be 51529 (changed)

       Found 1 zipcode value outside of Iowa, switched from 56201 to 52601

 3 All city values changed to uppercase

 4 Replace NaN by creating a dictionary with "City" as key and filled in corresponding "County" and "County Name" as values of       the dictionary
              Updated remaining NaN values for "County" manually
 
 5 Replace NaN values for "Category Name" using "Item Description" and correlating matching values
       * Manually updated related NaN values in "Category Name"       

## Data Analysis / EDA

In order to start forming decisions on locations to open a new store, it is necessary to evaluate possibilities for further data analysis and perform exploratory data analysis. To do this, the date was separated out into seperate columns of months and year to account for seasonality and a new year. Overall gross profit and gross profit per bottle was calculated to see expected profits by store. Number of transactions per county was also calculated. 

In addition, 2010 demographic data for land area per store and population per store was appended to provide a more robust and detailed analysis of our data. The thinking was that reach per store by populatin and alnd size would have an affect on sales. Correlating median sales in relationship to area per store and population per store resulted in no direct correlation.

To account for seasonality affect and differences between months and years, the data was split into 2015 sales and 2016 sales. After calculating the top 10 counties for gross profit and sales, Polk came out overwhelming at the top for both. This may be attributed to the population in the county and the capital city of Iowa being located in Polk.

Lastly, through the exploration of the data and plotting the data, we noticed two extreme outliers. The outliers skewed the liquor sales data to be overwhelmingly right- skewed. The outliers showed two stores having sales over $10 MM. To account for the right skew in our data, in determining average sales to predict our models, both median and mean were used to determine average.

## Data Mining

The EDA process helped formulate and ready the stage for the data mining process in analyzing which counties would be ideal for opening up a new liquor store location. Before moving forward into the data mining process, a few considerations and decisions needed to be taken.

First, 

Mean total sale per store across state is $206784.42
Median total sale per store across state is $71428.33
Standard deviation of total sale per store across state is $503127.27

Mean total bottles sold per store across state is 15689.05 bottles.
Median total bottles sold per store across state is 6579.0 bottles.

Standard deviation of total bottles sold per store across state is 31518.96 bottles.

### Best = Maximum total sale or Highest average sale?

Maximum total sales

Using maximum total sale as the indicative performance metric for a "good" location, we see that Polk County, is the overwhelming favourite location. As we saw from the earlier data exploration, the reasons for Polk's stellar performance was mainly due to:

1) The presence of 2 extreme outlying stores, with annual sale of between $9 to $10mil, 50 times more than 75% of all stores.
2) 208 stores in Polk, twice as many as the next highest county, Linn with 104. 75% of of the counties have 13 or less stores.

We envision that a client with strong financials, proven management record and liquor-store expertise, with the desire to gain market share, would be interested in establishing a presence in Polk.

Highest average sales

Another metric to describe liquor sale performance for a county is to consider the average store sale within the county and to pick the county with the "Highest average" sale.
In the case of a smaller scale expansion, "Highest average" is recommended, giving a more balanced consideration to competition and market size.

## Conclusion:

The liquor store data from the state of IOWA in 2015 and 2016 Q1, to answer the following:

- Identify suitable locations for a liquor store owner's expansion plans
- Create a model to predict future sales
- Recommend target for bottles sold and average bottle price

After cleaning the data, county demographic data (dated 2010) was used to supplement the existing dataset in search of a richer analysis. However, without detailed demographic data (such as age groups, gender, income range, etc), using simple land area per store and population per store yielded little value.

1) Location recommendation
After examining all 99 counties across the state of IOWA, 2 counties were selected as possible locations depending on the type of client and their needs.

For a typical store expansion plan (annual revenue of ~ $200k), Winneshiek was recommended for the following reasons:

- Top county for average sale per store
- Top county for average bottle sold per store
- 97th percentile for average bottle price
- 97th percentile for average bottle profit
- 68th percentile for average number of transactions per store
- 46th percentile for mean bottles per transaction
- Recommended average price per bottle ~ $15.50
- Recommended annual bottles sold ~ 21,000 bottles

For a large scale expansion (annual revenue of ~ $9mil per store), which requires access to a large market base, we recommended Polk County for the following reasons:

- Top county for total sales, i.e. largest market
- Top county for total bottle sold per store
- Top county for total number of transactions
- 54th percentile for average bottle price and average bottle profit
- Recommended average price per bottle ~ $19
- Recommended annual bottle sold ~ 500,000 bottles

2) Predictive modeling using linear regression
Predictive models were created for both the approaches to locations. Models were created using historical per store data from the respective counties using the following features:

- Median Bottle Cost per store
- Median Bottle Price per store
- Median Bottle Profit per store
- Sum Bottles sold per store
- Sum Volume sold per store
- No. of transactions per store

2015 Q1 data was used as the training set and 2016 Q1 data was used as the test set. Ridge regularization and cross-validation were conducted as part of the fitting process. Alpha was chosen by Ridge algorithm was 0.2 for regularization and was minimally effective in reducing RMSE. Model performance was considered mediocre with high r^2 (~ 0.95) but relatively high Root Mean Squared Error. Coefficients of the models were also significant.

Suggestions to improve the model include:

- Scaling the features
- Use of richer dataset for advanced feature engineering, such as the aforementioned demographics data
- Using logistical regression to take into account locations of individual stores within the county
- Include more historical data for time-series analyses of market trends over the years

In conclusion, this a much more complex project which involves heavy data munging and dataframe manipulations. Predictive modelling was limited in scope, primary due to the restriction to linear regression.
