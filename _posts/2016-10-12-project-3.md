# IOWA LIQUOR SALES 2015 - 2016

## Market Opportunity / Business Expansion

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that his team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront. 
       
### Which Iowa location is the best to open a new store?

The strategic thinking behind the decision to open a store in Iowa is dervied from 


## Risks & Assumptions: 



## Data Cleaning/ Munging

Steps in cleaning data: 

 1 Convert money columns from string to float

 2 Checking to see if all zipcodes have length of 5 and changed to integer
       
       Found 1 zipcode value '712-2', turns out to be 51529 (changed)
       
       Found 1 zipcode value outside of Iowa, switched from 56201 to 52601

 3 All city values changed to uppercase

 4 Replace NaN by creating a dictionary with "City" as key and filled in corresponding "County" and "County Name" as values of       the dictionary
              Updated remaining NaN values for "County" manually
 
 5 Replace NaN values for "Category Name" using "Item Description" and correlating matching values
       Manually updated related NaN values in "Category Name"

# Data Analysis (Observatory)

The Billboard Top 100 data library is imported using Pandas. Other packages that were imported include numpy, scipy, maplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. These python packages are used to form the analysis on the data in meaningful ways.

Some exploratory data analysis taken were the longevity and rank of all 317 songs. throughout 2000. Also, we looked at aggregate functions like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance and length by genre.

# Hypothesis Evaluation 

In order to analyze the hypothesis of rap music, the first step was to create another column with the days it took each song to peak. This was calculated by finding the difference of date the song entered the charts and the day the song peaked. By finding the mean day to peak by genre, we were able to see, which genre takes the longest to peak.

The graph below shows the average days a song takes to peak by genre.

The results show Latin, Electronica, and Country were actually the genre types that take the longest to peak. Rap was actually third in terms of fastest to rising to the peak (Jazz and R&B being the fastest)

Futhermore, to test the statistical relevance, P Value and T- Statistic models were used to determine wheter to reject the null or reject the alternative hypothesis.

## P Value & T- Statistic

By comparing each individual rap songs' time to peak compared to rest of the songs' times to peak, we were able to find the P Value and T- Statistic

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference regardless of genre on how long it takes for a song to peak.

The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference, specifically with rap music.

The T- test revealed T statistic of 1.90 and a P Value of .0577

Since the p-value is higher than the significance level, assuming an alpha of .05, the alternative hypothesis is rejected and the null hypothesis is true.

TO NOTE:
** It is hard to exactly determine whether to reject null or alternative hypothesis in this particular scenario because the P Value is only very slightly higher than the .05 (difference of .007) **

# Considerations

There are multiple considerations to observe when looking at this data. As mentioned earlier, some of the risk involved with this data is to observe how there is not sufficient data in each genre to correctly analyze and test the hypothesis. For example by finding the amount of songs in each genre that have it to the top 100, it is disproportionately in favor of Rock, Country, Rap, and R&B. Genres like Jazz, Reggae and Gospel only have one song in the top 100 in 2000. This can skew the data as it is only one point and the previous graph shows Jazz as the fastest genre to peak. 

In order to account for this looking at the relationship of mean days to peak with the amount of songs in each genre is crucial.

Below are charts showing the relationship between the days to peak by genre and the amount of songs in each genre.


The plot shows only 4 genres with more than 10 songs in the top 100 billboard and some correlation between amount of songs and average days to peak.

Lastly, it is important to consider proportion of time to peak (days on the chart) and how long the song has been in the top 100 by genre.

# Conclusion:

Using genre to predict time to peak is a mostly inconclusive process and prediction model. Other factors need to be taken into account to form a more accurate picture into which songs reach the peak the fastest and whether or not genre has an affect at all on time a song takes to peak.
